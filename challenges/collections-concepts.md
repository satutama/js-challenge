<h2 align="center">JavaScript challenges on Collections - concepts</h2>

<br>

### Q. Show the different ways of creating an array

- Arrays are the collection of values in javascript. Array is a special type of object in JavaScript
- Arrays values are indexed from 0 and have special property length which stores the count of elements present in array

###### References

<br />

### Q. Write a program to iterate over an array and print all the values of it

- Arrays can be iterated by using its index to fetch the values
- Arrays also can be iterated with for each style loops

<br />

### Q. Write a program to append and prepend, single or multiple values in to an array

- Values to the array can be appended using `push` method of array
- Values to the array can be prepended using `unshift` method of array

###### Notes

To remove the elements from the end of the array `pop` operation can be used but one element at a time. To remove the elements from the start of the array `shift` operation can be used but one element at a time

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift

<br />

### Q. Show insertion and removal of elements can happen in the array for given index

- Values of the array can be removed from any position using `splice` method of array
- Values of the array can also be inserted to any position using `splice` method of array
- 2nd argument is passed as 0 which inserts the elements without replacing
- The values passed after 2nd argument are considered for insertion

###### Notes

'count' indicates the number of elements to be removed from the index 'position'. Multiple values can be inserted or removed using `splice`

<br />

### Q. Show the different ways of emptying an array which has values

- Array can be emptied by giving a new reference of an empty array
- Setting the `length` of the array to 0 will automatically makes the array empty
- `pop` and `shift` operation on array can also be used to empty the array where each elements get removed

###### Notes

`splice` operation used here to empty the array is a trick by passing the length of the array as argument, where all the elements of the array get removed

<br />

### Q. Check if given input is an array or not

- `Array.isArray` is a method which checks if the given argument is an array or not
- Alternatively the `toString` method present on Object prototype can be used to check if it is an array

###### Notes

`typeof` operator cannot be used to check if a value is an array or not because array is an object and `typeof arr` returns us "object"

###### References

<br />

### Q. Show how an array in JavaScript can act like a stack and queue

- Stack is a 'Last In First Out' data structure can be achieved using `push` and `pop` operations
- Queue is a 'First In First Out' data structure can be achieved using `push` and `shift` operations

<br />

### Q. Create an array by removing all the holes of the array

- Holes are `undefined` value present inside array
- Holes do not get iterated in `filter` which will just fetch all the values except `undefined`

###### Notes

Holes can be formed when an array value by index is deleted. Example: `delete arr[index]`

<br />

### Q. Optimize the given statements having lot of logical checks to use a compact and cleaner logic

- Examples can be modified to store the values of comparision in an array and check for the presence of value if it is present inside array

###### Notes

Generally this use case can be implemented for `if` conditions

<br />

### Q. Write a program to iterate over a 2 dimensional array and print all the values of it

- Arrays can be iterated by using its index to fetch the values
- Arrays also can be iterated with for each style loops, with one loop to iterate the rows and inside it for cells

<br />

### Q. Write a program to store values in to a set

- Set lets us store unique values of any type
- Set can be created empty & then added with values or can be initialized also

###### References

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set

<br />

### Q. Write a program to store values in to a map

- `Map` holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys
- `Map` can be created empty & then added with values or can be initialized also with key-value pairs

###### Notes

Unlike objects, `Map` can have any primitive or object as the key

###### References

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map

<br />

### Q. Write a code to iterate over a set

- `set` is an iterable object and can be iterated using for..of loop
- `set` can also be iterated by simple `forEach` loop

<br />

### Q. Write a code to iterate over a map

- `map` is an iterable object and can be iterated using for..of loop
- `map` can also be iterated by simple `forEach` loop

<br />

### Q. Show how map is different from object to store key value pairs with coding example

- Map does not contain any keys by default unlike objects which has keys from its prototype
- Map's keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive) unlike object where keys are only strings
- The keys in Map are ordered in a simple, straightforward way
- The number of items in a Map is easily retrieved from its `size` property
- Map is an iterable object

###### Notes

Maps perform better than objects in most of the scenarios involving addition and removal of keys

<br />

### Q. Write a program to polyfill `filter` functionality of the Array

- `filter` iterates over the all values of array and passes value, index and array (itself) as the arguments
- Function returns a new array which filtering the values of the original array

###### Notes

The solution is a simple polyfill of `filter` and not intended to handle all the corner scenarios

<br />

### Q. Write a program to polyfill `map` functionality of the Array

- `map` iterates over the all values of array and passes value, index and array (itself) as the arguments
- Function returns a new array which is same as the length of the original array

###### Notes

The solution is a simple polyfill of `map` and not intended to handle all the corner scenarios

<br />

### Q. Write a program to polyfill `reduce` functionality of the Array

- `reduce` iterates over the all values of array and passes value, index and array (itself) as the arguments
- `reduce` accepts an optional initial value which when not provided can be skipped
- Function returns a single value after all the iteration

###### Notes

The solution is a simple polyfill of `reduce` and not intended to handle all the corner scenarios
